Each of these institutes is a research centre that welcomes researchers from all over the world in various fields.

Each year, the Institute's research fellows and partner institutions organize many scientific events on its premises, on fundamental research or in response to major societal problems.

These proceedings present the conferences, lecture series and other scientific productions of the Institutes for Advanced Studies in the form of indexed and quotable publications, often accompanied by videos or podcasts.
