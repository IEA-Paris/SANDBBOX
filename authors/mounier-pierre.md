**My initial education**, primarily as a Latinist, but with additional focus in literature, anthropology, information science, and communication, was latent training for a career I could not have foreseen, made possible only with the advent of digital technologies in the late 1990s. In the year 2000, as a first,  decisive, initiative, I founded *Homo Numericus*, a web magazine and portal for information and discussion on the relationship between technology and society. A few years later, combining my passion for both the humanities and the Internet, I put together a small electronic publishing team at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon. I subsequently joined *Revues.org* and the Center for Open Electronic Publishing, where I began as an instructor and where I now serve as Associate Director.  I continue my work on *Homo Numericus*, which now includes *Blogo Numericus*, written in collaboration with Marin Dacos, and am currently working on a book on the history of cyberspace, my primary research interest.

To my mind, one of the greatest challenges of our digital era is maintaining the relevance of the humanities, ensuring the survival and development of intellectual and cultural traditions in the midst of what is no less than a revolution.  Throughout history, all *tabula rasa* experiments have resulted in a return to barbarism.  How can we prevent this from happening once again?  Will the Iliad and the Odyssey live on through the new reading devices ? Is the wisdom of Montaigne audible in cyberspace? How can *A la Recherche du Temps Perdu*  be written today? Questions such as these, which are far from being resolved by the simple process of digitization, will be decisive for our future, in terms of our cultural landscape, our social relations, and our political environment. What form will the Digital City take? What are its promises and its dangers? How can we shape a future that satisfies us collectively? How can we avoid unknowingly creating our own technological hell? Can we conceive of, and conceive, a digital humanism? These are the issues that drive my work and my determination to make a lasting contribution.

From the start, my involvement in the digital world has been not only cultural, but also, and increasingly of late, political. Indeed, the question of democracy has been profoundly renewed by digital technology, leading to possibilities for new forms of governance. By combining understanding and action about what I consider to be the most important revolution of my time,  I hope to be able to live it fully, in an as engaged and clear-eyed way as I can.
